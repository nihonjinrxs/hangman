# Hangman, with PragDave

This app was me walking my way through @pragdave's Elixir for Programmers hands-on course project.

Some challenges to take on later (from his suggested projects, that I put off for later):

1. Add a computer player

> (Difficult) If you'd like an interesting challenge, write another application where the computer plays the hangman game. For a simple implementation you could just blindly guess letters, starting at the most frequent.
>
> You could then optimize it by looking at the possible words. You'll need to add a new API function to the dictionary to return all the words of a given length. You can then use that list to decide which letter will give you the most information based on the current game state.
